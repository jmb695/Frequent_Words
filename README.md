# Frequent_Words

This program finds all the links on a site homepage and separates them into 3 lists: 
  1. "Clean" links, or the links that do not include .jpg, .pdf, .css, etc. files
  2. Links to social media accounts
  3. Links within the site's domain
  
Given any of these lists, or a master list of links, the program will then create a nested list of every unique word used across all links and the frequency that each unique word is used.
